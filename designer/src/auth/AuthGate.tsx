/**
 * Sign-in wall. When Supabase auth is configured, the app is gated behind a
 * sign-in: visitors must create an account (or sign in) before they can use it.
 * To show what they're signing up for, the real editor is rendered blurred and
 * inert behind the centred sign-in card — the KiCad-like UI is right there,
 * just out of reach until you're in.
 *
 * (Guest-first entry was tried earlier but backfired — almost nobody signed in,
 * so the value of an account never landed. This puts the account up front while
 * still previewing the product behind the glass.)
 *
 * When auth is disabled (no Supabase env vars) the app runs fully offline and
 * this gate is a passthrough.

-- Ziro Designer — Supabase Storage for project file blobs.
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. This keeps large files OUT of Postgres
-- (storing blobs in the DB is what filled it and made it unhealthy); the
-- `projects` table then holds only metadata + the file list.
--
-- Objects are laid out as  <user_id>/<project_id>/<filename>.gz  and each user
-- can only touch their own folder (first path segment == their uid).
-- After running this, set  VITE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=projects  in the app env.

-- Create the private bucket (or make it in Dashboard → Storage → New bucket).
